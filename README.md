## Introduction

Design patterns offer tried-and-true solutions to recurring problems in software design. They enhance code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability. This repository provides a detailed look at each pattern with real-world scenarios to illustrate their practical applications.

## Design Patterns Overview

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns manage object creation, ensuring objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation. Examples include:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has a single instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on object composition, creating relationships between objects. Examples include:

- **Adapter**: Makes incompatible interfaces compatible.
- **Decorator**: Adds functionalities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures.
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with object interaction and responsibility distribution. Examples include:

- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Observer**: Notifies other objects about changes in an object's state.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Iterator**: Provides sequential access to aggregate elements.
- **Mediator**: Encapsulates interactions between objects.
- **State**: Changes an object's behavior based on its state.
- **Template Method**: Defines an algorithm skeleton but allows subclasses to override specific steps.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request through a chain of handlers.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's state.
- **Visitor**: Adds operations to objects without modifying them.
