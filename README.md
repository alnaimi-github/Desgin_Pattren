# Design Patterns in C#

Welcome to the Design Patterns in C# repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing common design patterns in C#. Design patterns are essential tools for creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient software solutions.

## Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a template for solving specific types of problems in object-oriented design. This repository includes a variety of design patterns implemented in C#, complete with explanations, usage examples, and best practices.

## Introduction

Design patterns are critical in software engineering as they provide tested solutions for common problems. They enhance code reusability and flexibility. This repository demonstrates each pattern with real-world examples and provides detailed explanations to help you understand their application.

## Design Patterns Overview

This repository covers three main categories of design patterns:

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and typically help to create relationships between objects. Examples include:

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together. Examples include:

- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Observer**: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class without change.
