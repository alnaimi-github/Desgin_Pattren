Introduction
Design patterns are invaluable in software engineering as they offer tried-and-true solutions for recurring problems. They enhance code reuse and flexibility. This repository illustrates each pattern with real-world scenarios and provides in-depth explanations to help you grasp their usage.

Design Patterns Overview
This repository covers three main categories of design patterns:

Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner that suits the situation. Examples include:

Singleton: Guarantees a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to modify the type of objects created.
Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, enabling different representations to be created with the same construction process.
Prototype: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype).
Structural Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and help create relationships between objects. Examples include:

Adapter: Makes incompatible interfaces compatible.
Decorator: Dynamically adds functionalities to an object without modifying its structure.
Facade: Simplifies the interface to a complex subsystem.
Composite: Allows objects to be composed into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Bridge: Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
Proxy: Provides a surrogate for another object to control access to it.
Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and their interactions. Examples include:

Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Observer: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state.
Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.
Iterator: Provides sequential access to elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
Mediator: Encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
State: Enables an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps.
Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
Memento: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
Visitor: Adds new operations to a class without modifying its structure.
